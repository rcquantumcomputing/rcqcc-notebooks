    "## Setting Up Your Environment\n",

    "\n",
    "### Required Packages\n",
    "We'll be using the following dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NumPy**: The fundamental library for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "* **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.\n",
    "* **SciPy**: An open-source Python library used for scientific and technical computing. It contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "To install these packages, you can use **pip**, the Python package installer. Execute the following code block:"
