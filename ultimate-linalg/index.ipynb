    "## Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "Before we start exploring the concepts of linear algebra, it's important to ensure that your Python environment is set up with all the necessary packages. This section guides you through installing the required libraries and importing them into your Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Packages\n",
    "We'll be using the following dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NumPy**: The fundamental library for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "* **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.\n",
    "* **SciPy**: An open-source Python library used for scientific and technical computing. It contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "To install these packages, you can use **pip**, the Python package installer. Execute the following code block:"
